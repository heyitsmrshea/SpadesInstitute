TAP classes teach outdated advice. Resume services charge $500 for templates. Veterans deserve better. I built Operation MOS. a free, AI-powered resume builder that tailors your military experience to your target civilian role. 30 minutes. One page. Actually works. <a href="https://app.operationmos.com">Try it free.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Last week, I launched Operation MOS. a free, AI-powered resume builder for veterans.</p>
<p>But here’s what keeps me up at night: <strong>60% of veterans are underemployed in their first year of separation.</strong> Not because they’re not qualified. Not because they lack skills. Because the entire career transition industry is teaching them advice that worked in 1995 but gets them <strong>rejected</strong> in 2026.</p>
<p>I’ve watched nonprofit resume workshops. I’ve seen veterans pay $500 for templates they could get for free. I’ve talked to hundreds of veterans stuck in the same cycle. great experience, terrible resumes, no callbacks. And I’m done watching it happen.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2>
<p>I know what it feels like to stare at a blank Word document, trying to explain why leading a platoon matters for a corporate job.</p>
<p>During my transition, I struggled with the same problem every veteran faces: translating my military experience into a resume that made sense to civilian employers. I didn’t understand how my leadership qualities could be relevant for a security-centric role. I got the same generic advice everyone gets. I tried the same expensive resume services.</p>
<p>I felt like I was starting over from zero. Like everything I’d accomplished didn’t matter anymore. Like I was less than.</p>
<p>But here’s what made the difference: Many veterans invested in me during my transition process. They didn’t just give me advice. they sat with me, helped me understand how my experience translated, and showed me what actually worked. They gave me something tangible I could use. Not another workshop. Not another appointment. A resume.</p>
<p>Now I’m at Microsoft, leading security teams around the world. And I want to give back.</p>
<p>There’s a culture in the veteran transition space that treats veterans like they’re broken. Like going into the civilian industry is impossibly hard and complicated. Like they need expensive courses and paid services just to have a shot.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that’s true.</p>
<p>Veterans have world-class skills. They’ve led teams in the most demanding environments on Earth. They’ve managed million-dollar budgets. They’ve solved problems under pressure that would break most people. They’ve earned security clearances that companies pay premium salaries to access. The transition shouldn’t be this complicated.</p>
<p>But here’s what I kept seeing: Veterans would have conversations with career counselors, attend workshops, sit through TAP classes. and walk away with nothing. No resume. Just more advice and another appointment to schedule. Another week of unemployment. Another month of self-doubt.</p>
<p>I wanted to change that. Every conversation with a veteran should end with something they can actually use. A resume in hand. Not just another “here’s what you should do” conversation.</p>
<p>A resume won’t get you a job. But it will open the door to an interview. And that’s the first step that matters.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-cost-of-getting-it-wrong">The Real Cost of Getting It Wrong</h2>
<p>Let me tell you what underemployment actually looks like.</p>
<p>It’s a combat veteran with a Top Secret clearance working retail because his resume said “managed sensitive operations” instead of “led cross-functional security teams.” It’s an E-7 with 18 years of leadership experience getting rejected by entry-level positions because the ATS couldn’t parse “NCOER” and “TIS.” It’s a military spouse watching their partner spiral because they can’t figure out why no one’s calling back.</p>
<p>The financial cost? An average of 4-6 months of unemployment. Thousands in savings drained. Credit cards maxed out during the gap.</p>
<p>The emotional cost? That’s harder to measure. The identity crisis of going from leading a platoon to wondering if you’re qualified for anything. The strain on marriages and families. The quiet shame of watching your savings drain while your inbox stays empty.</p>
<p>This isn’t about resumes. It’s about dignity. It’s about making sure the men and women who served our country don’t have to beg for jobs they’re overqualified for.</p>
<h2 id="the-translation-gap">The Translation Gap</h2>
<p>Every year, 200,000+ service members transition out of the military. They bring leadership, discipline, and operational expertise that Fortune 500 companies would pay top dollar for. But here’s what happens when they try to explain their experience:</p>
<p><strong>What Veterans Say:</strong> “Supervised 15-person fire team during 6-month OEF rotation”<br>
<strong>What Employers Hear:</strong> “…what’s OEF?”</p>
<p><strong>What Veterans Say:</strong> “Managed $2.3M MTOE property book with 100% accountability”<br>
<strong>What Employers Hear:</strong> ”…MTOE?”</p>
<p><strong>What Veterans Say:</strong> “E-7 with 18 years TIS, MOS 11B”<br>
<strong>What Employers Hear:</strong> “…is that good?”</p>
<p>The military teaches veterans to communicate in a language civilians don’t speak. The result? Resumes filled with acronyms that confuse hiring managers. Valuable experience that gets lost in translation. Qualified candidates filtered out by ATS systems. Months of unemployment that shouldn’t happen.</p>
<p>Take Mark, an Army Intelligence Officer transitioning to a Business Intelligence Analyst role. His military experience includes terms like “Executive Officer (XO),” “All-Source Intelligence,” and “Company Readiness.” To a civilian recruiter? That translates to “Operations Manager,” “Business Intelligence,” and “Operational Efficiency”. but only if someone helps make that connection. Without that bridge, Mark’s application never reaches a human.</p>
<h2 id="the-broken-solutions">The Broken Solutions</h2>
<p>The current “solutions” aren’t working.</p>
<p><strong>TAP Classes:</strong> A week-long curriculum that tries to cover everything. and ends up teaching outdated resume formats. Four-page resumes. Objective statements. Skills matrices. Advice from a different era that doesn’t land with modern recruiters.</p>
<p><strong>Resume Services:</strong> $300-500 for a template and a 3-week turnaround. Same generic bullets everyone else gets. No industry-specific tailoring. Just expensive templates that look exactly like everyone else’s.</p>
<p><strong>Nonprofit Workshops:</strong> Well-meaning but often taught by people who’ve never actually hired anyone. Outdated curriculums nobody updates. Programs designed for bureaucracy, not results.</p>
<p><strong>DIY Translation:</strong> Veterans spend months trying to figure it out alone. Translating military jargon into civilian language. Hoping it works. Getting rejected. Trying again. The cycle continues.</p>
<p>The entire industry is stuck in the past. and veterans are paying the price.</p>
<h2 id="what-employers-actually-want">What Employers Actually Want</h2>
<p>I talked to 50+ hiring managers last year. Asked them all the same question: “What do you look for in a veteran’s resume?”</p>
<p>Here’s what <strong>none of them</strong> said:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A good military-to-civilian translation”</li>
<li>“Clear MOS equivalents”</li>
<li>“O*NET crosswalk data”</li>
<li>“A comprehensive skills section”</li>
<li>“An objective statement”</li>
<li>“Every detail from their military career”</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s what <strong>every single one</strong> said:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Can they do THIS job?”</li>
<li>“Do they speak OUR language?”</li>
<li>“Can they show measurable impact?”</li>
<li>“Is it one page so I can scan it quickly?”</li>
</ul>
<p>The gap between what veterans are <strong>taught</strong> and what employers actually <strong>want</strong>? It’s massive. TAP classes teach MOS translation. Employers want role-specific language. Nonprofits teach 4-6 page resumes. Employers want one page. Resume writers focus on your past. Employers care about your fit for <strong>their</strong> future.</p>
<h2 id="but-i-dont-know-what-job-i-want">”But I Don’t Know What Job I Want”</h2>
<p>This is the question I hear most often. And it’s valid.</p>
<p>After years of having your career path laid out. promotions, assignments, duty stations. suddenly you’re staring at thousands of job titles that all blur together. Project Manager. Operations Analyst. Program Coordinator. What’s the difference? Which one fits?</p>
<p>Here’s the truth: You don’t need to have it all figured out before you start. Operation MOS is designed to help you explore. Build a resume targeting Project Management. Then build another one targeting Operations. See which version of your experience resonates more. See which language feels right.</p>
<p>The tool is free. You can build as many versions as you want. Use it as a career exploration tool, not just a resume builder.</p>
<p>Most veterans have transferable skills for dozens of roles. The question isn’t “What am I qualified for?” It’s “What do I want to do next?” And sometimes, seeing your experience translated into different industries helps you answer that question.</p>
<h2 id="the-unpopular-truth">The Unpopular Truth</h2>
<p>Here’s an unpopular opinion: <strong>Your resume won’t get you the job.</strong></p>
<p>It won’t make a hiring manager fall in love with you. It won’t showcase your “whole story.” It won’t prove you’re the best candidate.</p>
<p>Here’s what it <strong>will</strong> do: Check the HR box (“Did they submit one?”). Pass the ATS scan (if formatted correctly). Get you to the <strong>next</strong> stage (phone screen). That’s it.</p>
<p>So why do veterans spend 6 months perfecting it? Why do resume services charge $500? Why do nonprofits run week-long resume workshops? Because they’re selling you a lie: “The perfect resume will change your life.” It won’t.</p>
<p>The resume gets you <strong>TO</strong> the interview. <strong>YOU</strong> get the job <strong>AT</strong> the interview. Stop obsessing over making it perfect. Make it <strong>good enough</strong> to pass the scan. Then spend your energy preparing for the conversation.</p>
<p>30 minutes. One page. Role-specific language. That’s all you need. The rest is theater.</p>
<h2 id="we-dont-translate-your-past-we-tailor-your-resume-to-your-future">We Don’t Translate Your Past. We Tailor Your Resume to Your Future.</h2>
<p>Traditional services ask: “What was your MOS?” We ask: <strong>“What job do you want?”</strong></p>
<p>Then we build your resume <strong>backwards</strong>. starting from what the target employer values and showing why your military experience makes you the perfect fit.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Approach:</strong> Military Experience → Generic Translation → Hope It Works<br>
<strong>Operation MOS Approach:</strong> Target Role → Industry Language Analysis → Tailored Resume → Interviews</p>
<p>Same veteran. Same experience. Different target roles = different resumes.</p>
<p>A logistics officer has the same military experience. But targeting supply chain management? Different bullets, different language, different focus. Targeting operations management? Different bullets, different language, different focus.</p>
<p><strong>Your resume should be a bridge to where you’re going, not a museum of where you’ve been.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-it-actually-works">How It Actually Works</h2>
<p>Here’s how Operation MOS transforms military experience into civilian-ready resumes.</p>
<p>Mark, an Army Intelligence Officer, wants to become a Business Intelligence Analyst. He starts by telling us his target role. not his MOS equivalent, but the job he actually wants.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Define Your Mission</strong><br>
Mark inputs his contact details, military branch (U.S. Army), MOS code (35D), and most importantly. his target role: Business Intelligence Analyst. This target informs everything that follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Capture Your Experience</strong><br>
Mark enters his work history in plain language. “Improved readiness by tightening tracking and follow-up, which reduced last-minute issues before major events. Cut administrative rework by standardizing packet formats and using simple checklists.”</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: One-Click Transformation</strong><br>
With one click, our AI analyzes his input and generates professional, impact-oriented bullet points tailored for his target role:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Enhanced company readiness by implementing rigorous tracking and follow-up systems, significantly reducing last-minute issues prior to major events.”</li>
<li>“Streamlined administrative processes by standardizing packet formats and checklists, effectively cutting down rework and increasing efficiency.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience didn’t change. The language did. Now it’s speaking business intelligence, not military operations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Your Edge</strong><br>
Mark adds his skills and certifications. Security+, Certified ScrumMaster, Secret clearance. all aligned with his target role. These differentiators matter. A Secret clearance alone can add $10-20K to a salary offer in the right industry.</p>

<h2 id="why-ai-actually-works-and-experts-dont">Why AI Actually Works (And “Experts” Don’t)</h2>
<p>“AI can’t write resumes for veterans.” I’ve heard this 100 times since launch. Usually from paid resume writers protecting their business model, career counselors protecting their jobs, or people who haven’t actually tried it.</p>
<p>Here’s why they’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional “expert” approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Veteran describes their military job</li>
<li>Counselor tries to “translate” terms</li>
<li>Veteran gets generic bullets</li>
<li>Back-and-forth for 3 weeks</li>
<li>Pay $300-500</li>
<li>Get the same template everyone else gets</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operation MOS approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Veteran tells us their <strong>target role</strong></li>
<li>AI analyzes what <strong>that industry</strong> values</li>
<li>AI crafts bullets using <strong>that language</strong></li>
<li>Done in 30 minutes</li>
<li>Free</li>
</ol>
<p>The secret? We don’t try to “translate” military experience. We tailor it to what your target employer actually cares about. That’s the difference between a resume that gets interviews and one that gets ignored.</p>
<p>Mark’s journey from “Executive Officer, Intelligence” to “Business Intelligence Analyst” isn’t about finding the perfect MOS equivalent. It’s about showing how his experience in managing teams, coordinating complex operations, and producing decision-ready intelligence directly applies to analyzing business data, managing stakeholders, and driving strategic decisions. Same skills. Different language. Different focus. That’s the transformation.</p>
<p>The “experts” are afraid of AI because it exposes the truth: Most resume writing isn’t expertise. It’s templates + databases + time. AI does that better. Faster. Cheaper.</p>
<p>The future of career transition isn’t about “certified” anything. It’s about <strong>results</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="yeah-but">”Yeah, But…”</h2>
<p><strong>“But I need personalized help from a human.”</strong><br>
I get it. And for some things. interview coaching, salary negotiation, networking strategy. human mentorship is irreplaceable. But a resume? It’s a document that needs to pass an algorithm and get scanned by a recruiter in 6 seconds. AI is actually better at optimizing for that than humans are. Use Operation MOS for the resume. Save the human time for the conversations that matter.</p>
<p><strong>“AI can’t understand my unique military experience.”</strong><br>
Our AI is trained on military terminology, MOS codes from all branches, and thousands of military-to-civilian translations. It understands that a “Company Commander” is equivalent to a “General Manager” and that “NCOER” means performance evaluation. But more importantly, it’s not trying to translate your experience. it’s tailoring it to what your target employer cares about.</p>
<p><strong>“What if I’m not tech-savvy?”</strong><br>
If you can fill out a form, you can use Operation MOS. It’s a step-by-step guided process. No complex features. No confusing options. Just answer the questions, click the buttons, download your resume.</p>
<p><strong>“Is my data secure?”</strong><br>
Your information is encrypted and stored securely. We don’t sell your data. We don’t share it with recruiters unless you explicitly opt in. This isn’t a lead-generation scheme disguised as a resume tool. It’s a resume tool. Period.</p>
<h2 id="youve-got-your-resume-now-what">You’ve Got Your Resume. Now What?</h2>
<p><strong>Immediate next steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Download both formats</strong> – PDF for direct applications, DOCX for tweaking</li>
<li><strong>Build multiple versions</strong> – Different target roles = different resumes</li>
<li><strong>Share with a mentor</strong> – Get a second opinion from someone in your target industry</li>
<li><strong>Start applying</strong> – Your resume is ready. Don’t wait for “perfect.”</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Build 2-3 versions targeting different roles. Apply to all of them. See which gets more responses. Let the market tell you where you fit best.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-you-in-your-transition">Where Are You in Your Transition?</h2>
<p><strong>Active Duty (6-12 months out):</strong><br>
Start now. Use Operation MOS to explore different career paths. Build test resumes for different industries. Figure out what resonates before you’re under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Recently Separated (0-6 months):</strong><br>
You need a resume today. Build one in 30 minutes. Start applying. You can always refine it later, but you can’t get back the months you spent perfecting something instead of applying.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced Veterans (1+ years out):</strong><br>
Maybe your current resume isn’t working. Maybe you’re pivoting to a new industry. Build a fresh version targeting your new goal. Your military experience still matters. it just needs to be reframed.</p>
<p><strong>Military Spouses:</strong><br>
You’ve moved every 2-3 years. Your resume looks “scattered.” Use Operation MOS to reframe that as adaptability, resilience, and diverse experience. Those are strengths, not weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="why-free-and-how-we-stay-that-way">Why Free? (And How We Stay That Way)</h2>
<p>“If it’s free, I’m the product.” I’ve heard this concern. It’s fair.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth: Resumes will always be free. Always. No hidden fees. No premium tier that unlocks the “good” features. No bait-and-switch.</p>
<p>Why? Because I’ve seen too many veterans get exploited by an industry that profits from their confusion. Because I have a day job at Microsoft and don’t need this to pay my rent. Because the whole point is to remove barriers, not create new ones.</p>
<p>Future features. interview prep, LinkedIn optimization, cover letters. might not all be free. We’ll see. But the core resume builder? That’s free forever.</p>
<p>Every veteran deserves a fair shot at civilian success. The men and women who served our country shouldn’t struggle to explain why they’re qualified for jobs they can absolutely do. A DD-214 should be a launching pad, not a barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Veterans have given enough. Their resume shouldn’t cost them a paycheck.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h2>
<p>The resume was step one. But the entire career transition system is broken. So we’re not stopping here.</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interview prep AI (tailored to YOUR resume and target role)</li>
<li>LinkedIn profile optimization</li>
<li>Cover letter generation</li>
<li>Salary negotiation guidance</li>
<li>Real employer expectations (not outdated advice)</li>
</ul>
<p>The career transition industry has been gatekeeping success for too long. Charging for templates. Teaching outdated advice. Making veterans jump through hoops.</p>
<p><strong>That ends now.</strong></p>
<p>We’re building the complete toolkit veterans actually need.</p>
<h2 id="the-urgency">The Urgency</h2>
<p>Every week you spend perfecting your resume is a week you’re not applying. Every month of unemployment costs you financially, emotionally, and professionally.</p>
<p>The job market doesn’t wait. The bills don’t wait. Your family’s patience doesn’t wait.</p>
<p>Stop waiting for perfect. Start with good enough. Refine as you go.</p>
<p>30 minutes from now, you could have a professional, ATS-ready resume targeting the job you actually want. Or you could still be reading articles about resume tips.</p>
<p>Your call.</p>
