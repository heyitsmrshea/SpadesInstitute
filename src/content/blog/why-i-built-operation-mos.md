Last week, I launched Operation MOS—a free, AI-powered resume builder for veterans.

But here's what keeps me up at night: **60% of veterans are underemployed in their first year of separation.** Not because they're not qualified. Not because they lack skills. Because the entire career transition industry is teaching them advice that worked in 1995 but gets them **rejected** in 2026.

I've sat through TAP classes. I've watched nonprofit resume workshops. I've seen veterans pay $500 for templates they could get for free. And I'm done watching it happen.

## Why I Built This

I struggled with the same problem every veteran faces: translating my military experience into a resume that made sense to civilian employers. I didn't understand how my leadership qualities could be relevant for a security-centric role. I sat through the same TAP classes. I got the same generic advice. I paid for the same expensive resume services.

But here's what made the difference: Many veterans invested in me during my transition process. They took time to help me understand how my experience translated. They showed me what actually worked. They gave me something I could use.

Now I'm at Microsoft, leading security teams around the world. And I want to give back.

There's a culture in the veteran transition space that treats veterans like they're less than. Like going into the civilian industry is impossibly hard and complicated. Like they need 8-week courses and $500 resume services just to have a shot.

I don't think that's true.

Veterans have world-class skills. They've led teams in the most demanding environments on Earth. They've managed million-dollar budgets. They've solved problems under pressure that would break most people. The transition shouldn't be this complicated.

But here's what I kept seeing: Veterans would have conversations with career counselors, attend workshops, sit through TAP classes—and walk away with nothing. No resume. No deliverable. Just more advice and another appointment to schedule.

I wanted to change that. I wanted to ensure that every conversation I have with a veteran results in something tangible. A resume they can actually use. A deliverable they can walk away with. Not just another "here's what you should do" conversation.

A resume won't get you a job. But it will open the door to an interview. And that's the first step that matters.

## The Translation Gap

Every year, 200,000+ service members transition out of the military. They bring world-class leadership, discipline, and skills honed in the most demanding environments on Earth. But here's what happens when they try to explain their experience:

**What Veterans Say:** "Supervised 15-person fire team during 6-month OEF rotation"  
**What Employers Hear:** "...what's OEF?"

**What Veterans Say:** "Managed $2.3M MTOE property book with 100% accountability"  
**What Employers Hear:** "...MTOE?"

**What Veterans Say:** "E-7 with 18 years TIS, MOS 11B"  
**What Employers Hear:** "...is that good?"

The military teaches veterans to communicate in a language civilians don't speak. The result? Resumes filled with acronyms that confuse hiring managers. Valuable experience that gets lost in translation. Qualified candidates filtered out by ATS systems. Months of unemployment that shouldn't happen.

## The Broken Solutions

The current "solutions" aren't working:

- **TAP Classes:** 8-week curriculum teaching outdated resume formats. Four-page resumes. Objective statements. Skills matrices. This advice worked in 1995. It gets you rejected in 2026.
- **Resume Services:** $300-500 for a template and a 3-week turnaround. Same generic bullets everyone else gets. No industry-specific tailoring. Just expensive templates.
- **Nonprofit Workshops:** Well-meaning but often taught by people who've never actually hired anyone. Outdated curriculums nobody updates. Programs designed for bureaucracy, not results.
- **DIY Translation:** Veterans spend months trying to figure it out alone. Translating military jargon into civilian language. Hoping it works.

The veteran career transition industry is teaching advice that worked in 1995 but gets you **rejected** in 2026.

## What Employers Actually Want

I talked to 50+ hiring managers last year. Asked them all the same question: "What do you look for in a veteran's resume?"

Here's what **none of them** said:
- "A good military-to-civilian translation."
- "Clear MOS equivalents."
- "O*NET crosswalk data."
- "A comprehensive skills section."
- "An objective statement."
- "Every detail from their military career."

Here's what **every single one** said:
- "Can they do THIS job?"
- "Do they speak OUR language?"
- "Can they show measurable impact?"
- "Is it one page so I can scan it quickly?"

The gap between what veterans are **taught** and what employers actually **want**? It's massive. TAP classes teach MOS translation. Employers want role-specific language. Nonprofits teach 4-6 page resumes. Employers want one page. Resume writers focus on your past. Employers care about your fit for **their** future.

## The Unpopular Truth

Here's an unpopular opinion: **Your resume won't get you the job.** It won't make a hiring manager fall in love with you. It won't showcase your "whole story." It won't prove you're the best candidate.

Here's what it **will** do: Check the HR box ("Did they submit one?"). Pass the ATS scan (if formatted correctly). Get you to the **next** stage (phone screen). That's it.

A resume won't get you a job. But it will open the door to an interview. And that's the first step that matters.

So why do veterans spend 6 months perfecting it? Why do resume services charge $500? Why do nonprofits run 8-week resume workshops? Because they're selling you a lie: "The perfect resume will change your life." It won't.

The resume gets you **TO** the interview. **YOU** get the job **AT** the interview. Stop obsessing over making it perfect. Make it **good enough** to pass the scan. Then spend your energy preparing for the conversation. 30 minutes. One page. Role-specific language. That's all you need. The rest is theater.

## We Don't Translate Your Past. We Tailor Your Resume to Your Future.

Traditional services ask: "What was your MOS?" We ask: **"What job do you want?"** Then we build your resume **backwards**—starting from what the target employer values and showing why your military experience makes you the perfect fit.

**Traditional Approach:** Military Experience → Generic Translation → Hope It Works  
**Operation MOS Approach:** Target Role → Industry Language Analysis → Tailored Resume → Interviews

Same veteran. Same experience. Different target roles = different resumes. A logistics officer has the same military experience. But targeting supply chain management? Different bullets, different language, different focus. Targeting operations management? Different bullets, different language, different focus.

**Your resume should be a bridge to where you're going, not a museum of where you've been.**

## Why AI Actually Works (And "Experts" Don't)

"AI can't write resumes for veterans." I've heard this 100 times since launch. Usually from resume writers who charge $500, career counselors protecting their jobs, or people who haven't actually tried it.

Here's why they're wrong.

**Traditional "expert" approach:**
1. Veteran describes their military job.
2. Counselor tries to "translate" terms.
3. Veteran gets generic bullets.
4. Back-and-forth for 3 weeks.
5. Pay $300-500.
6. Get the same template everyone else gets.

**Operation MOS approach:**
1. Veteran tells us their **target role**.
2. AI analyzes what **that industry** values.
3. AI crafts bullets using **that language**.
4. Done in 30 minutes. Free.

The secret? We don't try to "translate" military experience. We tailor it to **where you're going**, not where you've been. That's the difference between a resume that gets interviews and one that gets ignored.

The "experts" are afraid of AI because it exposes the truth: Most resume writing isn't expertise. It's templates + databases + time. AI does that better. Faster. Cheaper. The future of career transition isn't about "certified" anything. It's about **results**.

## The Mission

Every veteran deserves a fair shot at civilian success. The men and women who served our country shouldn't struggle to explain why they're qualified for jobs they can absolutely do. A DD-214 should be a launching pad, not a barrier.

Operation MOS exists to close the gap between military excellence and civilian opportunity. **Resumes will always be free.** Fast. With the quality our veterans deserve. **Veterans have given enough. Their resume shouldn't cost them a paycheck.**

## What's Next

The resume was step one. But the entire career transition system is broken. So we're not stopping here.

Coming soon:
- Interview prep AI (tailored to YOUR resume)
- LinkedIn profile optimization
- Cover letter generation
- Salary negotiation guidance
- Real employer expectations (not outdated advice)

The career transition industry has been gatekeeping success for too long. Charging for templates. Teaching outdated advice. Making veterans jump through hoops. **That ends now.**

We're building the complete toolkit. **Resumes will always be free.** Fast. Actually helpful. Because veterans deserve tools as good as the Fortune 500s have. And they shouldn't have to pay $500 for public data and Word templates.

This is just getting started.
